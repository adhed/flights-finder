ASF has changed into using a more open governance model. This basically means that ASF is now governed by more people.\n2. An umbrella organisaton, json-schema-form, has been formed. As you can see, this repo is now a part of that Github organisation, not Textalk.\n\nProjects\n--------\nAfter a phase of planning, the following list of projects has been decided upon:\nhttps://github.com/json-schema-form/json-schema-form/wiki/Current-projects\n\nRelease 1.0\n-----------\nThe next major release of ASF will be 1.0.\n\nThe goal for that version is to include the breaking changes that is needed for future developments, like *Of and local $refs:\n\n* Break out the non-framework specific parts of ASF into a vanilla ES6 module\n* Remove the built-in bootstrap decorator, and in doing that require that users wanting to use that load that separately. The reason obviously being the material decorator.\n\nThe reason for the core break out is for all javascript-based ports of the json-schema-form concept to be able to share the same central code base.\nWork in that direction is being done in the [json-schema-form-core](https://github.com/json-schema-form/json-schema-form-core) repository.\n\nSchema builder UI\n-----------------\nThere is now a UI for building schemas and forms being developed at [json-schema-builder repository](https://github.com/json-schema-form/json-schema-builder).\n\nRalphael Owino (main author), has a [demo up already](http://ralphowino.github.io/schema-form-builder/#/builder).\n\nSchema and form repository\n--------------------------\nThis is now a [repository with template schemas and forms](https://github.com/json-schema-form/json-schema-form-repository).\nSo far all the [schema.org types](http://schema.org/docs/full.html) has been converted to JSON schema approximations, and also some has been further resolved and had (huge) forms generated. Schema.org is *big*.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nThe documentation is evolving, and it is happening mostly on the wiki:\n* [The ASF wiki](https://github.com/json-schema-form/angular-schema-form/wiki)\n* [The wiki of the json-schema-form organisation](https://github.com/json-schema-form/json-schema-form/wiki)\n\nNew Gitter rooms\n----------------\nThese are just started.\n* Discussions on the [general json-schema-form projects being carried out](https://gitter.im/json-schema-form/json-schema-form-projects)\n* Discussions on the [angular-specific ASF projects](https://gitter.im/json-schema-form/angular-schema-form-projects)\n\n\nThe Blog / The Web Site / The Twitter / The Movie\n=================================================\n[medium.com/@SchemaFormIO](https://medium.com/@SchemaFormIO) / [schemaform.io](http://schemaform.io) / [@SchemaFormIO](http://twitter.com/SchemaFormIO) / [Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duBFMipRq2o)\n\nIf you use ASF in your project/company please let us know! We'd love to feature you on the site.\n\nDemo Time!\n==========\n[Try out the example page](http://schemaform.io/examples/bootstrap-example.html). Try editing the schema or form definition and see what comes out!\n\nHint: By pressing the 'Save to gist' button (top left), you can save your example into a shareable link.\n\nWhat is it?\n===========\n\nSchema Form is a set of AngularJS directives (and a couple of services). It can do two things to\nmake life easier:\n\n1. Create a form directly from a JSON schema.\n2. Validate form fields against that same JSON schema.\n\nSchema Form uses convention over configuration, so it comes packaged with some sensible defaults.\nBut you can always customize it by changing the order and types of form fields.\n\n#### JSON Form\nSchema Form is inspired by the nice [JSON Form](https://github.com/joshfire/jsonform) library and\naims to be roughly compatible with it, especially its form definition. So what sets Schema Form\napart from JSON Form?\n\n1. Schema Form integrates deeply with AngularJS and uses AngularJS conventions to handle forms.\n2. Schema Form uses [tv4](https://github.com/geraintluff/tv4) for validation, making it compatible\n   with version 4 of the JSON schema standard.\n3. By default, Schema Form generates Bootstrap 3-friendly HTML.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nYou can find [all documentation here](docs/index.md), it covers all the different field types\nand their options.\n\nIt also covers how to [extend angular schema form with your own field types](https://github.com/Textalk/angular-schema-form/blob/master/docs/extending.md).\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nFirst, expose your schema, form, and model to the $scope.\n\n```javascript\nangular.module('myModule', ['schemaForm'])\n       .controller('FormController', function($scope) {\n  $scope.schema = {\n    type: \"object\",\n    properties: {\n      name: { type: \"string\", minLength: 2, title: \"Name\", description: \"Name or alias\" },\n      title: {\n        type: \"string\",\n        enum: ['dr','jr','sir','mrs','mr','NaN','dj']\n      }\n    }\n  };\n\n  $scope.form = [\n    \"*\",\n    {\n      type: \"submit\",\n      title: \"Save\"\n    }\n  ];\n\n  $scope.model = {};\n});\n```\n\nThen load them into Schema Form using the `sfSchema`, `sfForm`, and `sfModel` directives.\n\n```html\n<div ng-controller=\"FormController\">\n    <form sf-schema=\"schema\" sf-form=\"form\" sf-model=\"model\"></form>\n</div>\n```\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n### Bower\n\nIt's simplest to install Schema Form using [Bower](http://bower.io/).\n\n```bash\nbower install angular-schema-form\n```\n\nThis will install the latest release and basic dependencies. See\n[dependecies section below](#dependencies).\n\nYou can also load the files via [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/angular-schema-form).\n\n### Manual\n\nYou can also just download the contents of the `dist/` folder and add dependencies manually.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nSchema form has a lot of dependencies, most of which are optional. Schema Form depends on:\n\n1. [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) version 1.3.x is recomended. Version 1.2.x\n   has some limitation. See [known limitations](docs/knownlimitations.md).\n2. [angular-sanitize](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngSanitize)\n3. [tv4](https://github.com/geraintluff/tv4)\n4. [objectpath](https://github.com/mike-marcacci/objectpath)\n5. [bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/)\n\nIf you install via bower you get all of the above except bootstrap since we\ndon't want to push a certain version or flavor on you. Also make\nsure you got the angular version you actually want.\n\n\n#### Additional dependecies\n\n1. If you'd like to use drag-and-drop reordering of arrays, you'll also need [ui-sortable](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-sortable) and its [jQueryUI](http://jqueryui.com/) dependencies. See the *ui-sortable* documentation for details about which parts of jQueryUI are needed. You can safely ignore these if you don't need reordering.\n2. Schema Form provides tabbed arrays through the form type `tabarray`. Tab arrays default to tabs on the left side. For these to work, you'll need to include the CSS from [bootstrap-vertical-tabs](https://github.com/dbtek/bootstrap-vertical-tabs). However, you won't need Bootstrap Vertical Tabs for horizontal tabs (the `tabType: \"top\"` option).\n\nThe minified files include templates - no need to load additional HTML files.\n\n\n### Script Loading\n\nSchema form is split into two main files, `dist/schema-form.min.js` and\n`dist/boostrap-decorator.min.js` and they need be loaded in that order. AngularJS,\n[tv4](https://github.com/geraintluff/tv4) and [objectpath](https://github.com/mike-marcacci/objectpath)\nalso needs to be loaded *before* Schema Form.\n\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bower_components/angular/angular.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bower_components/angular-sanitize/angular-sanitize.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bower_components/tv4/tv4.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bower_components/objectpath/lib/ObjectPath.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bower_components/angular-schema-form/dist/schema-form.min.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bower_components/angular-schema-form/dist/bootstrap-decorator.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Module loading\nDon't forget to load the `schemaForm` module or nothing will happen.\n\n```javascript\nangular.module('myModule', ['schemaForm']);\n```\n\nAdd-ons\n------\nThere are several add-ons available, for a full list see the [web page](http://textalk.github.io/angular-schema-form/#third-party-addons).\nYour can also [create your own add-ons!](docs/extending.md)\n\nContributing\n------------\nContributions are welcome! Please see [Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.\n\nBuilding\n--------\nThe files in the `dist/` folder, plus dependencies, are all you need to use Schema Form. But if\nyou'd like to build it yourself, we use [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/).\n\nFirst off, you need to have nodejs installed. Then install all dev dependencies of the\nproject with npm, install gulp and run the default task.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n$ sudo npm install -g gulp\n$ bower install\n$ gulp\n```\n\nThe default task uses\n[gulp-angular-templatecache](https://github.com/miickel/gulp-angular-templatecache) to compile all\nhtml templates to js and then concatenates and minifies them with the rest of the sources.\n\nYou can also run `gulp watch` to have it rebuild on change.\n\nTests\n-----\nUnit tests are run with [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) and written using\n[mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/), [chai](http://chaijs.com/) and\n[sinon](http://sinonjs.org/)\n\nTo run the tests:\n\n1. Install all dependencies via NPM.\n2. Install dev dependencies with bower.\n3. Install the Karma CLI.\n4. Run the tests.\n\n```bash\n$ npm install\n$ bower install\n$ sudo npm install -g karma-cli\n$ karma start karma.conf.js\n```\n",
